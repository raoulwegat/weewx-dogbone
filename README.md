## Description

This is a [Weewx](http://www.weewx.com) mobile skin+extension that shows
Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) forecast and radar data in a beautiful
mobile-friendly format.

The skin is based on [SofaSkin](http://neoground.com/projects/weewx/) and uses [extensions](https://github.com/dcapslock/weewx-responsive-skin/wiki/Australian-%27Search%27-Extensions)
from [Weewx Responsive Skin](https://github.com/dcapslock/weewx-responsive-skin)
for the BOM data.

Additions are a new homescreen with 7-day forecast and warnings; zoomable animated
radar loop; new weather icons; new favicon.

This is largely a personal project to get my own personal weather station
data on my phone displayed in a way that I like.

## Installation

Install the skin in the `skins/` folder. You also need to
copy `user/aussearch.py` to your weewx _user_ folder. See [Custom code and extensions](http://www.weewx.com/docs/usersguide.htm#Custom_code_or_extensions) in the weewx users guide.
